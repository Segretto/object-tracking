## 2. Features
### 2.1 Vision Module [^1]
#### 2.1.1 Description:
An image processing algorithm that will extract information about the object's shape, color, position and speed.

#### 2.1.2 Functional Requirements
>**FR 1.1** &emsp;Use camera parameterization functions related to the frame capturing.

>**FR 1.2** &emsp;Apply detection (trigger), pre-processing and threshold functions to analyze a specific image area according to color and shape. 

>**FR 1.3** &emsp;Apply noise removal functions and polygonal approximation algorithms in order to determine the object center's postion and velocity.

>**FR 1.4** &emsp;Send the position and velocity values to the controller module.


### 2.2 Control System Module [^2] 
#### 2.2.1 Description:
This module will receive the object center position and velocity from the vision module and compute the desired Voltages to control the DC Motors.

#### 2.2.2 Functional Requirements
>**FR 2.1** &emsp;Receive the objects center posistion and velocity from vision module.

>**FR 2.2** &emsp;From pan-tilt adjustments, the beaglebone must ensure that the geometric center of the image is exactly aligned with the center of the camera. This is possible through a proportional-derivative-integrative (PID) control algorithm.

>**FR 2.3** &emsp;When the camera can no longer observe the object, it returns to the starting position.

### 2.3 Mechanical System [^3]
#### 2.3.1 Description:
A 2 DoF mechanism actuated by two DC motors coupled in a rigid rod mechanism, with a camera attached at one of itÂ´s end.  

#### 2.3.2 Functional Requirements
>**FR 3.1** &emsp;Vertical rotational actuation.

>**FR 3.2** &emsp;Horizontal rotational actuation.

### 2.4 User Interface **TBD** [^4]
#### 2.4.1 Description:
An Android application which will display performance metrics of the system in real time. 
It will also display controller parameters input slots for real time controller configuration.

#### 2.4.2 Functional Requirements
>**FR 4.1** &emsp;Open communication link with the beaglebone (TCP, Bluetooth,...). **TBD**

>**FR 4.2** &emsp;Receive performance metrics from the beaglebone MC.

>**FR 4.3** &emsp;Send sets of controller parameters inputs defined by the user.

## 3. System Qualities
### 3.1 Open Source  
The source code must be available for download and public contribution, under the MIT License.

### 3.2 Cost
The materials must cost the least convenient amount, that is, among all the viable systems, the one which costs less with the minimum required performance. 

### 3.3 Performance
The computer vision code must run without dependencies on external computing resources relative to the beaglebone; the camera must be capable of tracking the object without losing it, considering a moderate velocity (if the ball doesn't get further than half the FoV of the camera in one frame).

### 3.4 Real time    
The program must send commands to the motor in fixed time intervals that are close or smaller than the camera's FPS, considering the speed of the image processing methods being used.
